# day38_100
I am currently engaged in a 100-day Python Bootcamp, which I am documenting and sharing my progress on GitHub. The boot camp is designed to progressively intensify, allowing me to deepen my understanding and proficiency in Python programming.

Additionally, I have chosen to include the beginner, intermediate and advanced in my documentation to provide a valuable reference for my future growth and development.

# Daily Workout Tracker
This Python script allows you to track your daily exercises and log them into a Google Sheet automatically. The script uses the Nutritionix API to fetch exercise details and the Sheety API to log the exercise data.

## How It Works
- Load Environment Variables: The script loads environment variables from a .env file for secure handling of API keys.
- User Input: The script prompts the user to input the exercise they performed.
- Fetch Exercise Details: The script sends a POST request to the Nutritionix API to fetch details about the exercise.
- Log Exercise Data: The script logs the exercise data into a Google Sheet using the Sheety API.
